Datea is a corwdsourcing and civic engagement platform to create and visualize citizen reports (dateos) in maps, picture galleries, timelines and charts. It's mail goal is to allow citizens to share and visualize useful information for any purpose. It's flexibel, hashtag based structure allows anyone to create a map, timeline or gallery just by creating a report (dateo) using a hashtag. Furthermore, report iniciatives can be created by organizations such as NGOs, local governments and activists, which allow them to campaign for certain issues in order to obtain useful information from citizens (dateros).

If you are interested in using or contributing to this project, or want to know a litle bit more about us or the plattform, please feel free to contact us at contacto@datea.pe or via gitter (datea-gitter channel). For special a deployment or new feature, we also provide commercial support.

##Datea Api

This repo contains the server backend with all the endpoints necessary for the client apps (see other repos). It's based upong a bundle of tools and services, which makes it powerful, but complex to replicate and install. That's why we'd rather recommend using the existing API at https://api.datea.io/api/v2/ (read about the endpoints)
