datea-api
=========

Datea is a civic engagement platform. It is composed of a server API based on django and tastypie (this repo), a web client and a mobile client (see other repos).

The installation of this API involves a series of steps. A more detailed documentation will follow soon.

See the doc folder for info about how to use the API, which is not online yet.
